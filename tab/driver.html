            <h3>What does the list on the Driver window show me?</h3>
            <p>After the chef has updated an order so it is ready for delivery, the order will appear in this list.</p>

            <h3>How do I generate driving route?</h3>
            <p>First you need to mark the deliveries you are going to drive. Then you click the “Drivers” drop down menu and click your username so everyone else know that you got those deliveries covered. Afterwards you click the “Generate Driving Route”. The addresses in the list will appear on the map and it will show the fastest way to complete the driving route.</p>

            <h3>How do I mark an order as “delivered”?</h3>
            <p>Click on the “Delivered”-box and the order will automatically complete. When you do this, the order will disappear from the list.</p>

            <h3>How do I navigate on the map?</h3>
