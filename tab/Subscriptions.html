            <h3>How do I make a new subscription?</h3>
            <p>Firstly, you need to click the “New Subscription” button on the top-right.
            Then you need to choose the from-date and the to-date by clicking on the “…”-icons next to the dates. This is the time-period when the subscription will be active.
            Now you need to choose a weekday and add the recipes. You do this by marking the recipes in the window on the right side. You can search the recipes in the search bar over the window. You can double click the recipe or mark it and then click the left arrow to drag it over to the subscription information. A window will automatically pop up and you choose how many portions of the chosen recipe you want to add. You can comment below the recipe-list.
            You also need to add a time in the “Time”-bar over the recipe-list. This is when the subscriber wants the food delivered.
            When you choose more weekdays, you need to add the recipes for each of weekdays. You can go to which day you want to edit by clicking on the day-menu that comes up when you check more days.
            The “Frequency in weeks” option on the top right of the window decides how often the subscriber wants deliveries. For example, if it says 2 on a Monday, it means the subscriber only wants deliveries on Mondays every second week. If it says 3 it means every third week.
            Click the “New Subscription” to finish the process.</p>

            <h3>How do I show or edit a subscription?</h3>
            <p>You can double click on the subscription you want to show/edit or you can mark the subscription and click the “Show/Edit Subscription” button on the top-right. Here you can change the details you want about a subscription and finish the process by clicking “Edit Subscription”. If you do not want any changes, you can click “Cancel”.</p>

            <h3>How do I delete a subscription?</h3>
            <p>You mark the subscription you want to delete and click “Delete Subscription”.</p>

            <h3>How do I search for subscriptions?</h3>
            <p>Write what you want to find in the “Search Subscription”-bar to search through the subscription-database.</p>

            <h3>Which user types have access to the subscriptions panel?</h3>
            <p>Admin- and sale users have access to this panel.</p>
