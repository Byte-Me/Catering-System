            <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
            <h3>Map on driver tab loading before the tab changes</h3>
            <p>We are aware of the bug, and are looking into fixing it. This is only a visual thing, and has no real functionality disadvatages.</p>
            <h3>Editing Subscription creates duplicate subscription</h3>
            <p>Editing a subscription creates a new subscription with the new information, but does not remove the old subscription. </br>
            <b>Work around:</b> Edit subscription, then delete old version like deleting any other subscription.
